      <h3> 
        This goal aims to achieve gender equality between women and men in the world. The UN has reached many
        milestones in their path of equality in the world. So far, according to the UN SDG website, the goal of 
        gender equality cannot be achieved by 2030, and would take almost 300 years to acheive complete equality.
        The UN has 9 targets for gender equality, and so far, none of them have been met.
